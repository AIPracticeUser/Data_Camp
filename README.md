## 3. Manipulating Time Series Data in Python
### Instructor - Stefan Jansen

In this course you'll learn the basics of manipulating time series data. Time series data are data that are indexed by a sequence of dates or times. You'll learn how to use methods built into Pandas to work with this index. You'll also learn how resample time series to change the frequency. This course will also show you how to calculate rolling and cumulative values for times series. Finally, you'll use all your new skills to build a value-weighted stock index from actual stock data.
